# Complete Examples

In the following you can find two examples: one using regular webpack (recommended) and another one using [webpack-encore](https://github.com/symfony/webpack-encore) which builds on top of webpack with the goal to make the configuration easier.

**Please note:** these examples are only supposed to show how to use the plugin. They are not meant to be used for your project's assets management without further modification (e.g. dev **and** prod config).

- [webpack](webpack/)
- [webpack-encore](webpack_encore/)
